Paper Plan (4 pages workshop paper):
- Intro
	- The rise of foundation models
	- Beyond text, foundation models for time series
	- Omnipresence of time series-like (structured) data: example of model-based RL
	- motivation and contribution
- Preliminaries
	- time series forecasting foundation models
	- dynamics modeling in MBRL
	- evaluation metrics
- Challenges of MBRL data
	- multivariate
	- probabilistic
	- existence of covariates in the form of actions
	- non-stationarity: data collected with changing policy
- Experimental results
	- Main figure: aggregated score comparing different TSFMs on handful of environments
	- For probabilistic TSFMs, one figure showing uncertainty estimates comparison on at least one env
	- what happens during long-horizon forecasting
	- dynamic evaluation:
		- Not sure how this can be done because TSFMs need long context as input
		- say few words about it and leave it to future work
- Conclusion
