Project idea: MBRL (dynamics modeling) as a testbed for TSFMs
* Load datasets from Minari, evaluate TSFMs on zero shot forecasting
	* Add past and future actions as covariates and compare the results
* Compare different TSFMs (chronos2, etc)
* Single step MSE vs multi-step MSE
* For probabilistic FMs, compare probabilistic metrics (calibration / crps)

Keywords:
* MBRL: model-based reinforcement learning
* FM: Foundation Model
* TSFM: Time series forecasting foundation model
* MSE: mean squared error
